<h1 id"science"> what is science? </h1>
<p> 
Science, any system of knowledge that is concerned with the physical world and its phenomena and that entails unbiased observations and systematic experimentation.<br>
 In general, a science involves a pursuit of knowledge covering general truths or the operations of fundamental laws.
</p>
<h1> Physics </h1>
<p>
physics, science that deals with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics (from the Greek physikos) is concerned with all aspects of nature on both the macroscopic and submicroscopic levels.<br>
Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects under the action of given forces but also the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields. Its ultimate objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive principles that bring together and explain all such disparate phenomena.
</p>
<h1> Chemistry </h1>
<p>
chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes.<br>
Every substance, whether naturally occurring or artificially produced, consists of one or more of the hundred-odd species of atoms that have been identified as elements. Although these atoms, in turn, are composed of more elementary particles,<br>
they are the basic building blocks of chemical substances; there is no quantity of oxygen, mercury, or gold, for example, smaller than an atom of that substance. Chemistry, therefore, is concerned not with the subatomic domain but with the properties<br>
 of atoms and the laws governing their combinations and how the knowledge of these properties can be used to achieve specific purposes.

 <h1> Higher Math </h1>
 <p>
 Definition of higher mathematics in the English dictionary The definition of higher mathematics in the dictionary is abstract mathematics, including number theory and topology, that is more advanced than basic arithmetic,<br>
 algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. WORDS THAT BEGIN LIKE HIGHER MATHEMATICS

 (a-b)<sup>2</sup>=a<sup>2</sup>-2ab+b<sup>2</sup>
 </p>
 <h1> Biology </h1>
 <p>
 biology, study of living things and their vital processes. The field deals with all the physicochemical aspects of life. The modern tendency toward cross-disciplinary research and <br>
 the unification of scientific knowledge and investigation from different fields has resulted in significant overlap of the field of biology with other scientific disciplines.<br>
 Modern principles of other fields—chemistry, medicine, and physics, for example—are integrated with those of biology in areas such as biochemistry, biomedicine, and biophysics.

Biology is subdivided into separate branches for convenience of study, though all the subdivisions are interrelated by basic principles. Thus, while it is custom to separate the study<br>
of plants (botany) from that of animals (zoology), and the study of the structure of organisms (morphology) from that of function (physiology),<br>
all living things share in common certain biological phenomena—for example, various means of reproduction, cell division, and the transmission of genetic material.
